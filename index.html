        Speedshop is a one-man Ruby on Rails performance consultancy that
        optimizes the full stack - frontend, backend and environment - to generate
        revenue and cut scaling costs for businesses on Rails. It's not uncommon
        for Speedshop clients to halve their server costs and improve perceived load times by 300%. Fast sites are
        profitable sites. Speed is a feature.

      <h2>Who is Speedshop?</h2>

      <p>
        Speedshop is me,

        startups, including Craft Coffee (YC S14), Unwind Me (YC S14),
        Scaffold (500 Startups), Branch (now a division of Facebook) and
        many others. I'm a contributor to several open source projects, such
        as Ruby on Rails and Sentry.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Full-stack and user-first.</b> Your users have to go through
          the full stack to use your application - so we optimize at every
          level. HTML, JavaScript, CSS often contribute far more to perceived
          load than your application response times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Less before more.</b> No code is the fastest code. When given
          a choice, we prefer less code to more code, fewer dependencies,
          and smaller libraries. Do just enough to meet the requirements, and
          no more. This website, for example, weighs just 10KB.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>...but business comes first.</b> That's not to say that we eschew
          all complexity! Speedshop prefers modifying existing solutions rather
          than complete rewrites. The goal of performance optimization is either
          to save money by reducing server costs or increase revenue by providing
          a better user experience. Both of these goals have to be weighed against
          any performance optimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Not a rocketship.</b> Speedshop will never take outside equity
          funding.
        </li>
      </ul>
